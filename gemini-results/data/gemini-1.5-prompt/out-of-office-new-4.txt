The image shows a form for setting up an out-of-office (OOO) message. 

Here's a breakdown of the components:

1. Navigation Tabs:

 Agent Availability: This tab is not visible in the image, but it likely leads to a section for managing agent availability.
 Apply OOO: This tab is also not fully visible, but it likely leads to a section for applying OOO status.
 Apply for an agent: This tab is not fully visible, but it likely leads to a section for requesting an agent.
 Settings: This is the active tab, highlighted in blue, indicating the current section.

2. Configuration Section:

 "CONFIGURATION" Label: This label, in bold uppercase, indicates the start of the configuration section.
 "Send OOO notification when customer replies to ticket" Toggle: This toggle switch, currently in the off position, allows enabling or disabling automatic OOO notifications for customer replies.

3. Email Body Section:

 "Email Body" Label: This label indicates the section for customizing the OOO email message.
 Text Editor: A rich text editor with standard formatting options (bold, italics, underline, text alignment, lists, links, image insertion, attachments) for composing the OOO message. The current message reads: "Hey there, I am currently OOO. I will be back on the 14th. Your request will be redirected to another agent to help resolve the issue. Thanks"

4.  Additional Options:

 "Allow agent to edit the notification" Checkbox: This checkbox, currently checked, allows agents to modify the OOO notification template.
 Placeholder Fields: Grayed-out fields labeled "Agent Name," "Agent Email," "Requester Name," and "Ticket Url" demonstrate dynamic placeholders that will be populated with relevant information in the actual email.

5. Ticket Management:

 "Reassign ticket to group and agent" Toggle: This toggle switch, currently off, allows enabling or disabling automatic ticket reassignment when OOO is active.
 "Unassign ticket" Toggle: This toggle switch, currently off, allows enabling or disabling automatic un-assignment of tickets from the OOO agent.

6. Action Buttons:

 "Cancel" Button: This button likely discards any changes made and closes the settings.
