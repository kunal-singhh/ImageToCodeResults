The image shows a form for setting up out-of-office (OOO) notifications. 

Here's a breakdown of the components:

1. Navigation Tabs:

 Agent Availability: This tab is not visible in the image, but it's likely where users manage their availability status.
 Apply OOO: This tab, also not fully visible, is probably used to set OOO status with specific dates.
 Apply for an agent: This tab is likely used to request OOO coverage from another agent.
 Settings: This is the active tab, highlighted in blue, indicating the current section.

2. Configuration Section:

 "Send OOO notification when customer replies to ticket": This is a checkbox option. When enabled (toggle switched to the right), an automatic OOO notification is sent if a customer replies to a ticket while the agent is unavailable. 

3. Email Body Section:

 Text field: A large text field containing a sample OOO message. The message reads: "Hey there, I am currently OOO. I will be back on the 14th. Your request will be redirected to another agent to help resolve the issue. Thanks"
 Rich Text Editor Toolbar (B I U A TI ...):  Above the text field, this toolbar offers standard formatting options for the OOO message:
     B: Bold
     I: Italic
     U: Underline
     A: Font color
     TI: Text alignment
     Numbered List
     Bulleted List
     Insert Link
     Insert Image
     Insert Attachment

4. Additional Options:

 "Allow agent to edit the notification": This checkbox, when checked, allows agents to modify the default OOO message.
 Placeholders: Below the checkbox, there are placeholders for dynamically inserting information into the OOO message:
     Agent Name: The name of the agent who is OOO.
     Agent Email: The email address of the OOO agent.
     Requester Name: The name of the person who sent the ticket.
     Ticket Url: A direct link to the ticket.

5. Ticket Management:

 "Reassign ticket to group and agent": This option, when enabled, automatically reassigns the ticket to a different group or agent when the OOO status is active.
 "Unassign ticket": This option, when enabled, automatically unassigns the ticket from the OOO agent, leaving it in the queue.

6. Action Buttons:

 Cancel: Discards any changes made and closes the settings.
 Save: Saves the configured OOO settings.
