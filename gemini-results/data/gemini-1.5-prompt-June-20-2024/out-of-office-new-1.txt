The image appears to be a screenshot of a software interface, likely for managing customer support tickets. Here's a breakdown of the components:

Top Navigation:

 Agent Availability: Text button, likely for setting agent availability status.
 Apply OOO: Text button, likely for applying an "Out of Office" status.
 Apply for an agent: Text button, purpose unclear without further context.
 Settings: Text button, highlighted in blue, likely for accessing settings related to the current view.

Main Content Area:

 CONFIGURATION: Section header, indicating configuration options.
 Send OOO notification when customer replies to ticket: Checkbox with a toggle switch, currently in the "on" position. This likely controls whether an automatic OOO notification is sent when a customer replies to a ticket while the agent is unavailable.
 Email Body: Section header for customizing the OOO notification email.
 Rich Text Editor: A large text box with formatting options (bold, italics, underline, text alignment, lists, links, image insertion, attachments) for composing the email body. The current content reads: "Hey there, I am currently OOO. I will be back on the 14th. Your request will be redirected to another agent to help resolve the issue. Thanks"
 Allow agent to edit the notification: Checkbox, currently checked. This likely allows agents to modify the default OOO notification message.
 Agent Name, Agent Email, Requester Name, Ticket Url: Four grayed-out buttons, likely representing placeholders that can be inserted into the email body.
 Reassign ticket to group and agent: Checkbox with a toggle switch, currently in the "off" position. This likely controls whether tickets are automatically reassigned when an OOO status is applied.
 Unassign ticket: Checkbox with a toggle switch, currently in the "off" position. This likely controls whether tickets are automatically unassigned when an OOO status is applied.

Bottom Actions:

 Cancel: Text button, likely for discarding any changes and closing the view.
 Save: Text button, likely for saving any changes made to the configuration.

Possible Actions:

 Clicking on any of the top navigation buttons would likely navigate to the corresponding view or function.
 Toggling the "Send OOO notification" switch would enable or disable automatic OOO notifications.
 Editing the text in the rich text editor would change the content of the OOO notification email.
 Checking or unchecking the "Allow agent to edit the notification" checkbox would enable or disable agents' ability to customize the OOO message.
 Toggling the "Reassign ticket" and "Unassign ticket" switches would enable or disable automatic ticket reassignment or unassignment when applying OOO.
 Clicking "Cancel" would discard any unsaved changes and close the view.
 Clicking "Save" would save any changes made to the configuration.
