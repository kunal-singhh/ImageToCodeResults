Here's a breakdown of the components:

1. Navigation Tabs:

 Agent Availability: This tab is not visible in the image, but it likely leads to a section for managing agent availability.
 Apply OOO: This tab is also not fully visible, but it likely leads to a section for applying OOO status.
 Apply for an agent: This tab is partially visible and likely leads to a section for requesting an agent.
 Settings: This is the active tab, highlighted in blue, indicating that the user is currently in the settings section.

 Text Editor: This large text box with formatting options (bold, italics, underline, etc.) allows users to write and format their OOO message.

4. Additional Options:

 "Allow agent to edit the notification" Checkbox: This checkbox, currently checked, allows agents to edit the OOO notification before it's sent.
