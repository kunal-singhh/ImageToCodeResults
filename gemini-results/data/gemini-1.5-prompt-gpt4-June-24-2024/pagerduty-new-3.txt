1. Components:

 Title: "PagerDuty Incident Viewer"
     Text: "PagerDuty Incident Viewer"
     Position: Top left, below the top border 
     Style: Simple, bold, likely a larger font size than other text elements.

 Button: "Fetch PagerDuty Incidents"
     Text: "Fetch PagerDuty Incidents"
     Position: Centered below the title.
     Style: Filled rectangle with a contrasting background color (likely blue). Text is white or a light color for contrast.

     Position: Stacked vertically below the button, each separated by a thin line.
     Style:  Light grey background for each card.
     Content (for each card):
         Incident ID:
             Text: "XXXXXXXX" (placeholder for an actual ID)
             Position: Left aligned within the card.
         Title:
             Text: "XXXXXXXX" (placeholder for an incident title)
             Position: Left aligned below Incident ID.
         Status:
             Text: "XXXXXXXX" (placeholder for incident status, e.g., "Triggered," "Acknowledged")

2. Actions:

 "Fetch PagerDuty Incidents" Button: Clicking this button would likely trigger an API call to retrieve incident data from PagerDuty. The incident cards would then populate with the retrieved information. 
 Incident Cards:  Clicking on an incident card would likely lead to a detailed view of that specific incident. This detailed view could contain more information like timestamps, severity, assigned responders, and a log of actions taken.
