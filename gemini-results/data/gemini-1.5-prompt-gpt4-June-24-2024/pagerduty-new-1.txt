1. Components:

 Title: "PagerDuty Incident Viewer"
     Position: Top left, below the top border 
     Style: Simple, bold, likely a standard heading font.
 Button: "Fetch PagerDuty Incidents"
     Position: Below the title, aligned left.
     Style: Filled rectangle with a blue background and white text. Suggests an action to be taken.
 Incident Display Areas: (Three identical areas)
     Position: Stacked vertically below the button, each separated by a white space.
     Style: Each area is a light grey rectangle containing three labels:
         "Incident ID:"  Followed by placeholder text "XXXXXXXX"
         "Title:" Followed by placeholder text "XXXXXXXX"
         "Status:" Followed by placeholder text "XXXXXXXX"

2. Actions:

 "Fetch PagerDuty Incidents" Button: Clicking this button would likely trigger a process to retrieve incident data from PagerDuty and populate the "Incident Display Areas" with the retrieved information. 
 Incident Display Areas:  These areas are designed to display details of fetched incidents. It's unclear from the design alone if these areas are interactive (e.g., clickable to view more details about a specific incident).
